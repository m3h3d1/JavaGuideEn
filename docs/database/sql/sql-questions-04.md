## Window Functions

MySQL 8.0 added support for window functions. Common functions and their usage include:

1. `ROW_NUMBER()`: assigns a unique integer to each row in the result set.

```sql
SELECT col1, col2, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY col1) AS row_num
FROM table;
```

2. `RANK()`: calculates each row's rank in the ordered result.

```sql
SELECT col1, col2, RANK() OVER (ORDER BY col1 DESC) AS ranking
FROM table;
```

3. `DENSE_RANK()`: calculates each row's rank and does not leave gaps after ties.

```sql
SELECT col1, col2, DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY col1 DESC) AS ranking
FROM table;
```

4. `NTILE(n)`: divides the result into `n` nearly equal buckets and assigns a number to each bucket.

```sql
SELECT col1, col2, NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY col1) AS bucket
FROM table;
```

5. `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `COUNT()`, `MIN()`, and `MAX()`: these aggregate functions can also be used as window functions to calculate totals, averages, counts, minimums, and maximums within a window.

```sql
SELECT col1, col2, SUM(col1) OVER () AS sum_col
FROM table;
```

6. `LEAD()` and `LAG()`: `LEAD` returns a value from a later row at a specified offset; `LAG` returns a value from an earlier row.

```sql
SELECT col1, col2, LEAD(col1, 1) OVER (ORDER BY col1) AS next_col1,
                 LAG(col1, 1) OVER (ORDER BY col1) AS prev_col1
FROM table;
```

7. `FIRST_VALUE()` and `LAST_VALUE()`: `FIRST_VALUE` returns the first value in a window; `LAST_VALUE` returns the last value.

```sql
SELECT col1, col2, FIRST_VALUE(col2) OVER (PARTITION BY col1 ORDER BY col2) AS first_val,
                 LAST_VALUE(col2) OVER (PARTITION BY col1 ORDER BY col2) AS last_val
FROM table;
```

Window functions are generally used with an `OVER` clause, which defines the window, ordering, and partitioning.

### Top Three Scores in Each Exam Category

**Description:**

Sample data from `examination_info` (`exam_id`: exam ID, `tag`: category, `difficulty`: difficulty, `duration`: exam length, `release_time`: release time):

| id  | exam_id | tag  | difficulty | duration | release_time        |
| --- | ------- | ---- | ---------- | -------- | ------------------- |
| 1   | 9001    | SQL  | hard       | 60       | 2021-09-01 06:00:00 |
| 2   | 9002    | SQL  | hard       | 60       | 2021-09-01 06:00:00 |
| 3   | 9003    | 算法 | medium     | 80       | 2021-09-01 10:00:00 |

Sample data from `exam_record` (`uid`: user ID, `exam_id`: exam ID, `start_time`: attempt start time, `submit_time`: submission time, `score`: score):

| id  | uid  | exam_id | start_time          | submit_time         | score  |
| --- | ---- | ------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------ |
| 1   | 1001 | 9001    | 2021-09-01 09:01:01 | 2021-09-01 09:31:00 | 78     |
| 2   | 1002 | 9001    | 2021-09-01 09:01:01 | 2021-09-01 09:31:00 | 81     |
| 3   | 1002 | 9002    | 2021-09-01 12:01:01 | 2021-09-01 12:31:01 | 81     |
| 4   | 1003 | 9001    | 2021-09-01 19:01:01 | 2021-09-01 19:40:01 | 86     |
| 5   | 1003 | 9002    | 2021-09-01 12:01:01 | 2021-09-01 12:31:51 | 89     |
| 6   | 1004 | 9001    | 2021-09-01 19:01:01 | 2021-09-01 19:30:01 | 85     |
| 7   | 1005 | 9003    | 2021-09-01 12:01:01 | 2021-09-01 12:31:02 | 85     |
| 8   | 1006 | 9003    | 2021-09-07 10:01:01 | 2021-09-07 10:21:01 | 84     |
| 9   | 1003 | 9003    | 2021-09-08 12:01:01 | 2021-09-08 12:11:01 | 40     |
| 10  | 1003 | 9002    | 2021-09-01 14:01:01 | (NULL)              | (NULL) |

Find the top three users by score in each exam category. If two users have the same maximum score, rank the user with the higher minimum score first. If still tied, rank the user with the higher `uid` first. The sample output is:

| tid  | uid  | ranking |
| ---- | ---- | ------- |
| SQL  | 1003 | 1       |
| SQL  | 1004 | 2       |
| SQL  | 1002 | 3       |
| 算法 | 1005 | 1       |
| 算法 | 1006 | 2       |
| 算法 | 1003 | 3       |

**Explanation:** The categories with scored attempts are SQL and Algorithms. For SQL, users 1001, 1002, 1003, and 1004 have maximum scores of 81, 81, 89, and 85, and minimum scores of 78, 81, 86, and 40. Ranking by maximum score, then minimum score, gives 1003, 1004, and 1002 as the top three.

**Answer:**

```sql
SELECT tag,
       UID,
       ranking
FROM
  (SELECT b.tag AS tag,
          a.uid AS UID,
          ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY b.tag
                             ORDER BY b.tag,
                                      max(a.score) DESC,
                                      min(a.score) DESC,
                                      a.uid DESC) AS ranking
   FROM exam_record a
   LEFT JOIN examination_info b ON a.exam_id = b.exam_id
   GROUP BY b.tag,
            a.uid) t
WHERE ranking <= 3
```

### Exams Where the Second-Fastest and Second-Slowest Durations Differ by More Than Half the Exam Length (Advanced)

**Description:**

Sample data from `examination_info` (`exam_id`: exam ID, `tag`: category, `difficulty`: difficulty, `duration`: exam length, `release_time`: release time):

| id  | exam_id | tag  | difficulty | duration | release_time        |
| --- | ------- | ---- | ---------- | -------- | ------------------- |
| 1   | 9001    | SQL  | hard       | 60       | 2021-09-01 06:00:00 |
| 2   | 9002    | C++  | hard       | 60       | 2021-09-01 06:00:00 |
| 3   | 9003    | 算法 | medium     | 80       | 2021-09-01 10:00:00 |

Sample data from `exam_record` (`uid`: user ID, `exam_id`: exam ID, `start_time`: attempt start time, `submit_time`: submission time, `score`: score):

| id  | uid  | exam_id | start_time          | submit_time         | score  |
| --- | ---- | ------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------ |
| 1   | 1001 | 9001    | 2021-09-01 09:01:01 | 2021-09-01 09:51:01 | 78     |
| 2   | 1001 | 9002    | 2021-09-01 09:01:01 | 2021-09-01 09:31:00 | 81     |
| 3   | 1002 | 9002    | 2021-09-01 12:01:01 | 2021-09-01 12:31:01 | 81     |
| 4   | 1003 | 9001    | 2021-09-01 19:01:01 | 2021-09-01 19:59:01 | 86     |
| 5   | 1003 | 9002    | 2021-09-01 12:01:01 | 2021-09-01 12:31:51 | 89     |
| 6   | 1004 | 9002    | 2021-09-01 19:01:01 | 2021-09-01 19:30:01 | 85     |
| 7   | 1005 | 9001    | 2021-09-01 12:01:01 | 2021-09-01 12:31:02 | 85     |
| 8   | 1006 | 9001    | 2021-09-07 10:02:01 | 2021-09-07 10:21:01 | 84     |
| 9   | 1003 | 9001    | 2021-09-08 12:01:01 | 2021-09-08 12:11:01 | 40     |
| 10  | 1003 | 9002    | 2021-09-01 14:01:01 | (NULL)              | (NULL) |
| 11  | 1005 | 9001    | 2021-09-01 14:01:01 | (NULL)              | (NULL) |
| 12  | 1003 | 9003    | 2021-09-08 15:01:01 | (NULL)              | (NULL) |

Find exams where the difference between the second-fastest and second-slowest completion times is greater than half the exam duration. Sort by exam ID in descending order. The sample output is:

| exam_id | duration | release_time        |
| ------- | -------- | ------------------- |
| 9001    | 60       | 2021-09-01 06:00:00 |

**Explanation:** Exam 9001 completion times are 50 minutes, 58 minutes, 30 minutes and 1 second, 19 minutes, and 10 minutes. The difference between the second-fastest and second-slowest is 50 - 19 = 31 minutes. Since the exam lasts 60 minutes, this exceeds half its duration. Return the exam ID, duration, and release time.

**Approach:**

First, rank each exam's completion times in ascending and descending order; this is subquery `a`.

Then join the results with the exam information table `b`, group by exam ID, and use `HAVING` to select the second-ranked times. Convert seconds to minutes for comparison, then sort by exam ID in descending order.

**Answer:**

```sql
SELECT a.exam_id,
       b.duration,
       b.release_time
FROM
  (SELECT exam_id,
          row_number() OVER (PARTITION BY exam_id
                             ORDER BY timestampdiff(SECOND, start_time, submit_time) DESC) rn1,
          row_number() OVER (PARTITION BY exam_id
                            ORDER BY timestampdiff(SECOND, start_time, submit_time) ASC) rn2,
                                              timestampdiff(SECOND, start_time, submit_time) timex
   FROM exam_record
   WHERE score IS NOT NULL ) a
INNER JOIN examination_info b ON a.exam_id = b.exam_id
GROUP BY a.exam_id
HAVING (max(IF (rn1 = 2, a.timex, 0))- max(IF (rn2 = 2, a.timex, 0)))/ 60 > b.duration / 2
ORDER BY a.exam_id DESC
```

### Largest Time Window Between Consecutive Exam Attempts (Advanced)

**Description:**

Sample data from `exam_record` (`uid`: user ID, `exam_id`: exam ID, `start_time`: attempt start time, `submit_time`: submission time, `score`: score):

| id  | uid  | exam_id | start_time          | submit_time         | score |
| --- | ---- | ------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ----- |
| 1   | 1006 | 9003    | 2021-09-07 10:01:01 | 2021-09-07 10:21:02 | 84    |
| 2   | 1006 | 9001    | 2021-09-01 12:11:01 | 2021-09-01 12:31:01 | 89    |
| 3   | 1006 | 9002    | 2021-09-06 10:01:01 | 2021-09-06 10:21:01 | 81    |
| 4   | 1005 | 9002    | 2021-09-05 10:01:01 | 2021-09-05 10:21:01 | 81    |
| 5   | 1005 | 9001    | 2021-09-05 10:31:01 | 2021-09-05 10:51:01 | 81    |

For each user who attempted exams on at least two days in 2021, calculate the largest interval between consecutive attempts (`days_window`) and the average number of exams they would attempt over that many days, based on their history that year. Sort by the interval and average attempt count in descending order. The sample output is:

| uid  | days_window | avg_exam_cnt |
| ---- | ----------- | ------------ |
| 1006 | 6           | 2.57         |

**Explanation:** User 1006 attempted exams on September 1, 6, and 7, 2021. The largest interval between consecutive attempts is six days (September 1 to 6). They attempted three exams over seven days, an average of 3/7 = 0.428571 exams per day. Over six days, the average is 0.428571 × 6 = 2.57 exams (rounded to two decimal places). User 1005 attempted two exams on September 5 but has records for only one day, so they are excluded.

**Approach:**

The explanation above mentions deduplicating attempts, but do not deduplicate them; doing so fails the test cases. Note that the records are limited to 2021.

Also add one day to the date difference, and include attempts that were not submitted. The problem statement is unclear on these points.

**Answer:**

```sql
SELECT UID,
       max(datediff(next_time, start_time)) + 1 AS days_window,
       round(count(start_time)/(datediff(max(start_time), min(start_time))+ 1) * (max(datediff(next_time, start_time))+ 1), 2) AS avg_exam_cnt
FROM
  (SELECT UID,
          start_time,
          lead(start_time, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY UID
                                    ORDER BY start_time) AS next_time
   FROM exam_record
   WHERE YEAR (start_time) = '2021' ) a
GROUP BY UID
HAVING count(DISTINCT date(start_time)) > 1
ORDER BY days_window DESC,
         avg_exam_cnt DESC
```

### Completion Counts for Users with No Incomplete Attempts in Their Last Three Active Months

**Description:**

Sample data from `exam_record` (`uid`: user ID, `exam_id`: exam ID, `start_time`: attempt start time, `submit_time`: submission time; `NULL` means incomplete, `score`: score):

| id  | uid  | exam_id | start_time          | submit_time         | score  |
| --- | ---- | ------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------ |
| 1   | 1006 | 9003    | 2021-09-06 10:01:01 | 2021-09-06 10:21:02 | 84     |
| 2   | 1006 | 9001    | 2021-08-02 12:11:01 | 2021-08-02 12:31:01 | 89     |
| 3   | 1006 | 9002    | 2021-06-06 10:01:01 | 2021-06-06 10:21:01 | 81     |
| 4   | 1006 | 9002    | 2021-05-06 10:01:01 | 2021-05-06 10:21:01 | 81     |
| 5   | 1006 | 9001    | 2021-05-01 12:01:01 | (NULL)              | (NULL) |
| 6   | 1001 | 9001    | 2021-09-05 10:31:01 | 2021-09-05 10:51:01 | 81     |
| 7   | 1001 | 9003    | 2021-08-01 09:01:01 | 2021-08-01 09:51:11 | 78     |
| 8   | 1001 | 9002    | 2021-07-01 09:01:01 | 2021-07-01 09:31:00 | 81     |
| 9   | 1001 | 9002    | 2021-07-01 12:01:01 | 2021-07-01 12:31:01 | 81     |
| 10  | 1001 | 9002    | 2021-07-01 12:01:01 | (NULL)              | (NULL) |

For each user whose attempts in their three most recent active months are all complete, count completed exams. Sort by completed exam count and user ID in descending order. The sample output is:

| uid  | exam_complete_cnt |
| ---- | ----------------- |
| 1006 | 3                 |

**Explanation:** User 1006's three most recent active months are 202109, 202108, and 202106. They attempted three exams, all complete. User 1001's three most recent active months are 202109, 202108, and 202107. They attempted five exams, four of which are complete, so they are excluded.

**Approach:**

1. Group by user to count completed exams among users with no incomplete attempts in their last three active months.
2. Rank active months in descending order with `DENSE_RANK()` and keep ranks up to 3.
3. Count attempts.
4. Apply the remaining conditions.
5. Sort the results.

**Answer:**

```sql
SELECT UID,
       count(score) exam_complete_cnt
FROM
  (SELECT *, DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY UID
                             ORDER BY date_format(start_time, '%Y%m') DESC) dr
   FROM exam_record) t1
WHERE dr <= 3
GROUP BY UID
HAVING count(dr)= count(score)
ORDER BY exam_complete_cnt DESC,
         UID DESC
```

Among the 50% of users with the highest incompletion rates on SQL exams, report the total and completed exam attempts for level 6 and 7 users in each of their three most recent active months. Sort by user ID and month in ascending order.

The sample output is:

| uid  | start_month | total_cnt | complete_cnt |
| ---- | ----------- | --------- | ------------ |
| 1002 | 202002      | 3         | 1            |
| 1002 | 202003      | 2         | 1            |
| 1002 | 202005      | 2         | 1            |

Explanation: Each user's incomplete attempts, total attempts, and incompletion rate for SQL exams are:

| uid  | incomplete_cnt | total_cnt | incomplete_rate |
| ---- | -------------- | --------- | --------------- |
| 1001 | 3              | 7         | 0.4286          |
| 1002 | 4              | 8         | 0.5000          |
| 1003 | 1              | 1         | 1.0000          |

Users 1001, 1002, and 1003 have percentile ranks of 1.0, 0.5, and 0.0, respectively. The top 50% (rank <= 0.5) are users 1002 and 1003.

User 1003 is neither level 6 nor level 7.

The three most recent active months are 202005, 202003, and 202002.

During those months, user 1002 made 3, 2, and 2 attempts, with 1 completed attempt in each month.

**Approach:**

Note: Count all attempts and completed attempts. Use SQL exams to rank users by incompletion rate, and use levels 6 and 7 to filter the exam records.

First, rank users by incompletion rate:

```sql
SELECT UID,
       count(submit_time IS NULL
             OR NULL)/ count(start_time) AS num,
       PERCENT_RANK() OVER (
                            ORDER BY count(submit_time IS NULL
                                           OR NULL)/ count(start_time)) AS ranking
FROM exam_record
LEFT JOIN examination_info USING (exam_id)
WHERE tag = 'SQL'
GROUP BY UID
```

Next, find each user's records from their three most recent active months:

```sql
SELECT UID,
       date_format(start_time, '%Y%m') AS month_d,
       submit_time,
       exam_id,
       dense_rank() OVER (PARTITION BY UID
                          ORDER BY date_format(start_time, '%Y%m') DESC) AS ranking
FROM exam_record
LEFT JOIN user_info USING (UID)
WHERE LEVEL IN (6,7)
```

**Answer:**

```sql
SELECT t1.uid,
       t1.month_d,
       count(*) AS total_cnt,
       count(t1.submit_time) AS complete_cnt
FROM-- First, rank users by incompletion rate.

  (SELECT UID,
          count(submit_time IS NULL OR NULL)/ count(start_time) AS num,
          PERCENT_RANK() OVER (
                               ORDER BY count(submit_time IS NULL OR NULL)/ count(start_time)) AS ranking
   FROM exam_record
   LEFT JOIN examination_info USING (exam_id)
   WHERE tag = 'SQL'
   GROUP BY UID) t
INNER JOIN
  (-- Next, retrieve records from the three most recent active months.
 SELECT UID,
        date_format(start_time, '%Y%m') AS month_d,
        submit_time,
        exam_id,
        dense_rank() OVER (PARTITION BY UID
                           ORDER BY date_format(start_time, '%Y%m') DESC) AS ranking
   FROM exam_record
   LEFT JOIN user_info USING (UID)
   WHERE LEVEL IN (6,7) ) t1 USING (UID)
WHERE t1.ranking <= 3 AND t.ranking >= 0.5 -- Keep rows that meet the ranking conditions.

GROUP BY t1.uid,
         t1.month_d
ORDER BY t1.uid,
         t1.month_d
```

For each exam category, calculate the year-over-year growth in completed attempts for the first half of 2021 compared with the first half of 2020. Format growth as a percentage rounded to one decimal place, and calculate the change in completion-count rank. Sort by growth rate and 2021 rank in descending order.

The sample output is:

| tag | exam_cnt_20 | exam_cnt_21 | growth_rate | exam_cnt_rank_20 | exam_cnt_rank_21 | rank_delta |
| --- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | ---------- |
| SQL | 3           | 2           | -33.3%      | 1                | 2                | 1          |

Explanation: In the first half of 2020, completed attempts were recorded for three categories: C++, SQL, and PYTHON. Their completion counts were 3, 3, and 2, with ranks 1, 1 (tied), and 3.

In the first half of 2021, completed attempts were recorded for two categories: Algorithms and SQL. Their counts were 3 and 2, with ranks 1 and 2:

| tag    | start_year | exam_cnt | exam_cnt_rank |
| ------ | ---------- | -------- | ------------- |
| C++    | 2020       | 3        | 1             |
| SQL    | 2020       | 3        | 1             |
| PYTHON | 2020       | 2        | 3             |
| 算法   | 2021       | 3        | 1             |
| SQL    | 2021       | 2        | 2             |

Only SQL has data for both periods. Its completed attempts decreased from 3 to 2, a decline of 33.3% (rounded to one decimal place), and its rank moved from 1 to 2.

**Approach:**

The main challenge is ensuring the integer type supports negative values. Use `CAST()` to convert the value to `SIGNED`.

The growth rate is `(exam_cnt_21 - exam_cnt_20) / exam_cnt_20`.

The rank change is how many places the 2021 rank moved compared with 2020.

Calculate it as `exam_cnt_rank_21 - exam_cnt_rank_20`.

In MySQL, `CAST()` converts an expression from one data type to another. Its basic syntax is:

```sql
CAST(expression AS data_type)

-- Convert a string to an integer.
SELECT CAST('123' AS INT);
```

This function is straightforward, so no further examples are needed.

In physics and statistics, min-max normalization (also called rescaling) is a linear transformation that maps original values to the range [0, 1].

The transformation is:

![](../images/shared/29A377601170AB822322431FCDF7EDFE.png)

For each hard exam, apply min-max normalization to the scores and scale them to [0, 100]. Return the user ID, exam ID, and average normalized score. Sort by exam ID in ascending order, then normalized score in descending order. (Scores are assumed to be in [0, 100]. If an exam has only one score, keep it unchanged instead of applying the formula.)

The sample output is:

| uid  | exam_id | avg_new_score |
| ---- | ------- | ------------- |
| 1001 | 9001    | 98            |
| 1003 | 9001    | 0             |
| 1002 | 9002    | 88            |
| 1003 | 9002    | 75            |
| 1001 | 9002    | 70            |
| 1004 | 9002    | 0             |

Explanation: Exams 9001, 9002, and 9003 are hard exams.

There are three attempts on exam 9001, with scores 68, 89, and 90. The normalized scores are 0, 95, and 100. The latter two scores belong to user 1001, so that user's new score for exam 9001 is (95 + 100) / 2 ≈ 98 (keep the integer part). User 1003's new score is 0. Sort by exam ID in ascending order, then normalized score in descending order.

**Approach:**

Key points:

1. For hard exams, use `MAX()` and `MIN()` window functions to get the maximum and minimum score for each exam. Apply the normalization formula and scale the result to [0, 100] by multiplying by 100.
2. If an exam has only one score, do not apply the formula. Since `max_score = min_score = score`, the formula would produce 0.
3. Group the final result by `uid` and `exam_id` and calculate the average normalized score. Filter out `NULL` scores.

Finally, apply the formula carefully. The problem may look complicated, but the steps are manageable.

Explanation: Exam 9001 has attempts in four months: 202001, 202002, 202003, and 202005. The monthly counts are 2, 1, 3, and 1, and the cumulative counts are 2, 3, 6, and 7.

**Approach:**

There are two key requirements: calculate the cumulative attempt count through each month, and return each exam's monthly and cumulative counts.

The key expression is `SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER (PARTITION BY exam_id ORDER BY DATE_FORMAT(start_time, '%Y%m'))`.

**Answer:**

```sql
SELECT exam_id,
       date_format(start_time, '%Y%m') AS start_month,
       count(*) AS month_cnt,
       sum(count(*)) OVER (PARTITION BY exam_id
                           ORDER BY date_format(start_time, '%Y%m')) AS cum_exam_cnt
FROM exam_record
GROUP BY exam_id,
         start_month
```

For each month since the first exam attempt, return the number of monthly active users, new users, the maximum monthly new-user count through that month, and the cumulative number of users through that month. Sort by month in ascending order.

The sample output is:

| start_month | mau | month_add_uv | max_month_add_uv | cum_sum_uv |
| ----------- | --- | ------------ | ---------------- | ---------- |
| 202001      | 2   | 2            | 2                | 2          |
| 202002      | 4   | 2            | 2                | 4          |
| 202003      | 3   | 0            | 2                | 4          |
| 202005      | 1   | 0            | 2                | 4          |

| month  | 1001 | 1002 | 1003 | 1004 |
| ------ | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 202001 | 1    | 1    |      |      |
| 202002 | 1    | 1    | 1    | 1    |
| 202003 | 1    |      | 1    | 1    |
| 202005 |      | 1    |      |      |

The matrix shows that two users were active in January 2020 (`mau = 2`), and both were new users that month.

In February 2020, four users were active, two users were new, the largest monthly new-user count so far was two, and the cumulative user count was four.

**Approach:**

The main challenges are:

1. Calculating new users each month.

2. Calculating the cumulative activity through each month.

The general process is:

1. Find each user's first active month with `MIN()`.

2. Calculate monthly active users and new users. Find each user's first active month, then group by that month to count new users.

3. Calculate the maximum monthly new-user count and cumulative user count through each month, then sort by month in ascending order.

**Answer:**

```sql
-- Return the maximum monthly new-user count and cumulative users through each month, sorted by month.
SELECT
	start_month,
	mau,
	month_add_uv,
	max( month_add_uv ) over ( ORDER BY start_month ),
	sum( month_add_uv ) over ( ORDER BY start_month )
FROM
	(
	-- Count monthly active users and new users.
	SELECT
		date_format( a.start_time, '%Y%m' ) AS start_month,
		count( DISTINCT a.uid ) AS mau,
		count( DISTINCT b.uid ) AS month_add_uv
	FROM
		exam_record a
		LEFT JOIN (
	         -- Find each user's first active month.
		SELECT uid, min( date_format( start_time, '%Y%m' )) AS first_month FROM exam_record GROUP BY uid ) b ON date_format( a.start_time, '%Y%m' ) = b.first_month
	GROUP BY
		start_month
	) main
ORDER BY
	start_month
```
